# Hackathon

Welcome to the Eigensolvers Quantum School Hackathon. In the notebook found in this folder there are 4 problems covering all the materials covered in the lectures. These problems have been designed for people coming from all different levels of experience in quantum computing. You will get a different certificate level based on the problems you completed:

- First two: Beginner
- First three: Intermediate
- All four: Advanced

There are also prizes for the winners of the hackathon:

- First Place: RasQberry - Premium
- Second Place: RasQberry - All Inclusive
- Third Place: RasQberry - Customizable DIY Kit

The ranking will be based on the weighted cost of the solutions for problem 3 and problem 4; as defined in the notebook. 

The deadline for submission is Sunday (July 11th) 7pm Indian Standard Time. Remember, the ultimate goal is to have fun and learn some quantum computing while you're at it. All the best!
