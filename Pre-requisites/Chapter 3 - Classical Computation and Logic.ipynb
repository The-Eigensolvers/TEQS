    "So far, we have laid out the mathematical foundation necessary for introductory quantum computing, which as shown before, is mere vector and matrix algebra. This third, and short, chapter will be dedicated towards defining a few basic concepts of classical computation, not because it is a necessary prerequisite (although it does help), but rather to describe how information could be processed using classical deterministic rules, as opposed to the ones that will be presented in the next chapter. The Python Module that will be used here is <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/truth-table-generator/\">Truth-Table-Generator</a> which, as the name suggests, is used to generate truth tables by simply passing the logic operations through the function ```ttg.Truths()```."

    "## 3.1 What is Computation?\n",
    "\n",
    "   According to _Google_, a computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. In other words, it is a device that one can, in one way or another, use to process information using a series of steps that one defines. These series of steps are called algorithms, and can be as simple as adding two numbers or as complex as suggesting which cat videos you would prefer to watch on YouTube. However, all of these terms are ambiguous, as one could ask questions such as \"What is meant by information? How is it represented? How are these logical operations implemented to begin with?\" The answer is that there are an infinite  number of ways that computation can be performed. The model that is ubiquitously used, however, is the method of using digital circuits to represent and process binary data (i.e information that could be in one of two states, typically represented by 1 or 0). Physically, this model of information proccessing could be implemented by using a device called a transistor which has the ability to switch between high voltage signals (i.e 1) and low voltage signals (i.e 0). Your computer likely has billions of those, which, using complex architecture, work together to process the information and run the algorithms necessary to output programs like operating systems, web browsers, amazing Jupyter Notebooks about Quantum Information, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Binary?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   It is common knowledge that computers process information in binary form. To answer why this is, let us think about one of the simplest algorithms: counting. Historically, people have counted in multiple ways. The most primitive way to count is by using a system that represents the number $n$ with $n$ units of, say, a stripe **I**. For example, the number 5 could be represented by **IIIII**, and the number 13 by **IIIIIIIIIIIII**. If a computer were to implement this _tally_ system for counting, then it could represent the number $n$ by $n$ high voltage signals (i.e $n$ 1s). This is a very inefficient model, and even with an algorithm as simple as counting, will very quickly prove to be inept. For this reason, a digital system must be deployed, as it offers an exponentially more efficient way of representing data. For instance, the following image shows the number of digits (and concequently, number of transistor-like devices) necessary to represent the number 13.\n",
    "  <img src=\"assets/13.png\">\n",
    "   \n",
    " As you can see, it takes 13 digits to represent 13 in base 1 (tally), four digits to represent it in base 2 (binary), three digits to represent it in base 3 (trinary), two digits to represent it in base 4 to 13 (quaternary to tridecimal) and only 1 digit to represent it in base 14+. The graph almost looks negative exponential, which suggests that the higher the base, the more efficient the model. So why base two and not a higher base? Can't we define a system with low voltage, high voltage and even higher voltage? The answer is that while that is possible, and we can theoretically build a computer with any number of possible states, the two state system will prove to be most efficient, maybe not in terms of number of transistors, but in terms of design. For this reason, the bit (a 1 or 0) is called the base unit of classical information.\n",

    "## 3.4 Quantum Computing and Its Purpose \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of weeks into my quantum computing journey, I had the privilege of meeting Prof. Scott Aaronson with a few friends of mine over a web conference. My memory is a bit faint but I remember one of the first questions asked went along the lines of \"Can you solve [some problem] with a quantum computer?\" Dr. Aaronson responded the following in a manner so instinctive, it would perhaps be safe for one to assume that he gets asked similar questions on a daily basis: \"Well, yeah you can do that. Except there wouldn't be any noticable speedup. Quantum Computing doesn't change the theory of computability, meaning that everything that can be solved on a quantum computer, can also be solved on a classical computer, it's just that for some problems, a classical computer may take exponentially more time to compute it\". In my opinion, this is a great \"one-liner\" which explains a lot about why quantum computing is being so heavily investigated, because by using the logic that will later on be described, one can potentially design an algorithm which highly outperforms the current classical versions in terms of efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Richard Feynman noticed this in a talk he gave in 1982, where he said that the current model of computation (i.e classical computers) cannot efficiently model quantum systems in a scalable manner. He gave the following expample: Suppose you have an electron which could either be spin up or spin down. To represent every possible states, one would need two bits (1 for spin up and 1 for spin down), now if there are two electrons, one would need 4 bits, and for $n$ electrons, one would need $2^n$ bits... this gets exponentially less practical and is not an issue of scalability, but rather in the model itself. With a series of quantum bits (i.e bits that could be in a superposition of 1 and 0 at the same time), the number of qubits necessary to model $n$-electron spins would be reduced to $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, problems outside of modeling quantum systems are also being investigated at the moment and there is a whole field dedicated towards what can and can't be efficiently solved by a quantum computer"
